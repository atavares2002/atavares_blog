# André Tavares Next.js + Tailwind CSS Portfolio (ATAVARES)

Project developed while following the step-by-step tutorial provided by @adrianhajdin from [https://www.jsmastery.pro](https://www.jsmastery.pro) available on YouTube [https://youtu.be/HYv55DhgTuA] (https://youtu.be/HYv55DhgTuA).
Thanks for sharing.

## Few improvements

I´ve added a few improvements and modifications my self and I will keep the project available as my personal digital portfolio. Instead of mapping all objects and indexes in PostDetail.jxs, I´ve added ReactMarkdown to PostDetail.jxs and changed the content type in getPostDetails funcition to markdown. Fits my needs perfectly
